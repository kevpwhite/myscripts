# 🛠 Kevin's Home Lab Script Library

Welcome to my personal collection of shell scripts and automation tools, built to power my homelab, media server, and Linux-based infrastructure. These scripts are designed for high-performance, low-maintenance systems — with real-world use across Debian, TrueNAS SCALE, Proxmox, Docker, and more.

## 📂 Script Categories

Each script has its own folder with a dedicated README and usage instructions.

| Folder                          | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `media-remux`                   | Batch convert `.mkv` video files to `.mp4` for Jellyfin/Plex |


> 💡 Scripts are modular and production-ready. Feel free to fork and adapt.
